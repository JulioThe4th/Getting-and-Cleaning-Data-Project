# CodeBook

This code book describes the variables in the tidy dataset `tidyData.txt`.

## Variables

- `SubjectID`: Identifier for the subject who performed the activity.
- `ActivityID`: Identifier for the activity performed.
- `ActivityLabel`: Descriptive name of the activity performed.
- `...`: Mean and standard deviation measurements for various features (e.g., `tBodyAcc-mean-X`, `tBodyAcc-std-X`, etc.).

## Transformations

1. Merged the training and test datasets.
2. Extracted measurements on mean and standard deviation.
3. Labeled the dataset with descriptive variable names.
4. Created a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
